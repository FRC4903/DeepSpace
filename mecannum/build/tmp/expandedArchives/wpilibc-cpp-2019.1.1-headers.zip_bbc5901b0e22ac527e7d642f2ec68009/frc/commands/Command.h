/**
 * The Command class is at the very core of the entire command framework.
 *
 * Every command can be started with a call to Start(). Once a command is
 * started it will call Initialize(), and then will repeatedly call Execute()
 * until the IsFinished() returns true. Once it does,End() will be called.
 *
 * However, if at any point while it is running Cancel() is called, then the
 * command will be stopped and Interrupted() will be called.
 *
 * If a command uses a Subsystem, then it should specify that it does so by
 * calling the Requires() method in its constructor. Note that a Command may
 * have multiple requirements, and Requires() should be called for each one.
 *
 * If a command is running and a new command with shared requirements is
 * started, then one of two things will happen. If the active command is
 * interruptible, then Cancel() will be called and the command will be removed
 * to make way for the new one. If the active command is not interruptible, the
 * other one will not even be started, and the active one will continue
 * functioning.
